# EFT-Tracker Project Notes

## Development Workflow

### After Pushing Code

Always clear the Next.js cache after pushing code to ensure changes are visible:

```bash
rm -rf .next && npx prisma generate
```

Then restart the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Development Server Port

**IMPORTANT:** Always use port 3000 for the dev server. Never use alternative ports (3001, 3002, etc.) as this can cause confusion and authentication issues with NextAuth callbacks.

If port 3000 is in use:

1. Find the process: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
2. Kill it: `cmd /c "taskkill /F /PID <PID>"`
3. Then start the server on port 3000

### Database Schema Changes

After modifying `prisma/schema.prisma`, sync to remote database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 with Turbopack
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon)
- NextAuth for authentication
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Browser Automation Tools (MCP)

Two browser automation MCP servers are available. Use the appropriate one based on the task:

### Playwright (`mcp__playwright__*`) - PRIMARY TOOL

Use for:

- **E2E testing** - Taking snapshots, verifying UI state, testing user flows
- **Cross-browser testing** - When Safari/Firefox compatibility matters
- **Visual verification** - Screenshots and accessibility snapshots
- **Form interactions** - Multi-field forms, complex UI interactions
- **Debugging the app** - `browser_snapshot` provides accessibility tree for reliable element targeting

Key tools:

- `browser_navigate` - Go to URL
- `browser_snapshot` - Get accessibility tree (preferred over screenshots for interaction)
- `browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_fill_form` - Interactions
- `browser_take_screenshot` - Visual capture

**Note:** This project's E2E tests use the Playwright test runner (`npx playwright test`), which is separate from the MCP tools. The MCP tools are for ad-hoc browser automation during development.

### Puppeteer (`mcp__puppeteer__*`) - SECONDARY TOOL

Use for:

- **Quick one-off scripts** - Simple automation that only needs Chrome
- **PDF generation** - When generating documents
- **Direct JavaScript execution** - When you need `puppeteer_evaluate` for complex DOM manipulation
- **Lightweight scraping** - Quick data extraction tasks

Key tools:

- `puppeteer_navigate` - Go to URL
- `puppeteer_screenshot` - Take screenshot
- `puppeteer_click`, `puppeteer_fill` - Basic interactions
- `puppeteer_evaluate` - Run arbitrary JS

### Decision Matrix

| Task                        | Use                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Testing the EFT-Tracker app | Playwright                      |
| Verifying UI changes        | Playwright (`browser_snapshot`) |
| Cross-browser check         | Playwright                      |
| Quick wiki scrape           | Puppeteer                       |
| Generate PDF report         | Puppeteer                       |
| Complex form testing        | Playwright                      |
| Debug element selectors     | Playwright (`browser_snapshot`) |

### Running E2E Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test --ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test homepage.spec.ts
```

### Branch Naming Convention

**IMPORTANT:** Use full prefixes, not abbreviated ones. CI enforces these exact prefixes:

- `feature/` (new features) - NOT `feat/`
- `fix/` (bug fixes)
- `bugfix/` (bug fixes - alternative)
- `hotfix/` (critical production fixes)
- `docs/` (documentation only)
- `refactor/` (code refactoring)
- `test/` (test additions)
- `chore/` (maintenance tasks)

Example: `feature/add-user-dashboard`

### Pull Request Workflow

After creating a PR, automatically monitor CI status using the GitHub check-runs API:

```bash
# Get PR head SHA first, then check runs
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/andrew-tucker-razorvision/EFT-Tracker/commits/{SHA}/check-runs" | jq -r '.check_runs[] | "\(.status) \(.conclusion // "pending") - \(.name)"'
```

1. Get the PR's head commit SHA from `mcp__github__get_pull_request`
2. Use curl with the check-runs API (NOT `mcp__github__get_pull_request_status` - that uses the old status API which doesn't work with GitHub Actions)
3. If any check has `status: "in_progress"` or `"queued"`, check again after ~60 seconds
4. When all checks complete, notify the user with:
   - Final status (success/failure)
   - Link to the PR
   - If failed, which checks failed
5. If checks pass and PR is ready, ask if user wants to merge

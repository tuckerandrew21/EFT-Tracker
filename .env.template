# Options: development, production, test
# Production Notes:
#   - Next.js automatically sets this in production builds
#   - You typically don't need to set this manually
#   - Use "test" when running automated tests
# NODE_ENV=development

# ===========================================
# Database Configuration (Required)
# ===========================================

# PostgreSQL connection string
# Options:
#   - Local: postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/eft_tracker

#   - Supabase: postgresql://postgres:password@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
#
# Production Notes:
#   - Use Neon pooler endpoint for production (ends with -pooler.*.neon.tech)
#   - Example: postgresql://user:pass@ep-xyz-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb
#   - Connection pooling is built-in with the pooler endpoint
DATABASE_URL=op://DevSecrets/Neon/Connection String

# Staging Database (Optional)
# Use Neon database branching to create isolated staging environment
# See docs/DATABASE_BRANCHING.md for setup instructions
# DATABASE_URL_STAGING=postgresql://user:pass@ep-staging-pooler.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb

#   - Rotating this invalidates all active user sessions
#   - Store backup in password manager
AUTH_SECRET=

# App URL (use http://localhost:3000 for local development)
# Production Notes:

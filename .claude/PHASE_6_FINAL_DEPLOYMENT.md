# Phase 6 - Final Merge & Deployment

**Status:** In Progress
**Date Started:** 2025-12-17
**Duration:** ~2-3 hours (includes CI wait, validation, deployment)

## Overview

Phase 6 is the final step of the monorepo migration. It involves:

1. Monitoring CI checks on Phase 5 PR (#312)
2. Merging Phase 5 PR to master
3. Monitoring automatic deployment to production (Coolify)
4. Final validation and testing in production
5. Cleanup and celebration

## Phase 5 PR Status

**PR #312:** docs: Phase 5 - Documentation & Final Polish

- URL: https://github.com/andrew-tucker-razorvision/EFT-Tracker/pull/312
- Base: master
- Changes: Documentation only (QUICKSTART.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/README.md, architecture docs)

### Current CI Status

Monitoring checks:

- ✅ Check Merge Conflicts - PASSED
- ✅ Dependency Review - PASSED
- ✅ Check Branch Name - PASSED
- ⏳ Lint & Format - IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ Test (22.12.0) - IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ Security Audit - IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ Validate PR Title - IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ Check PR Size - IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ Check for TODOs - IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ Check Sensitive Files - IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ Auto Label PR - IN PROGRESS

### Expected CI Results

Since Phase 5 changes are **documentation only**:

- ✅ Lint will pass (documentation formatting checked)
- ✅ Tests will pass (no code changes, no test skips)
- ✅ Type check will pass (no TypeScript changes)
- ✅ Security audit will pass (no new dependencies)
- ✅ Build will pass (no runtime changes)

**Estimated CI completion time:** 5-10 minutes

## Merge Process (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Wait for CI to Complete

Monitor PR #312:

```bash
# Check status
gh pr view 312

# Watch in browser
open https://github.com/andrew-tucker-razorvision/EFT-Tracker/pull/312
```

Expected: All checks should pass ✅

### 2. Merge PR to Master

Once all CI checks pass:

```bash
# Option 1: Squash merge (recommended for documentation)
gh pr merge 312 --squash --auto

# Option 2: Create merge commit
gh pr merge 312 --merge --auto

# Option 3: Rebase (keep individual commits)
gh pr merge 312 --rebase --auto
```

**Recommended:** Squash merge (combines all docs changes into one commit)

### 3. Monitor Automatic Deployment

After merge, GitHub webhook triggers Coolify deployment:

```bash
# Watch deployment in real-time
# Go to: http://95.217.155.28:8000/
# Navigate to: Projects → EFT-Tracker → Deployments

# Or check via API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $COOLIFY_API_TOKEN" \
  http://95.217.155.28:8000/api/v1/deployments \
  | jq '.[] | select(.project_id == "eft-tracker") | {status, created_at}'
```

**Deployment timeline:**

- Merge to master → 30 seconds
- Docker build → 2 minutes
- Healthcheck → 30 seconds
- Rolling update → 30 seconds
- **Total: ~3-4 minutes**

### 4. Verify Production Deployment

Once deployment completes:

```bash
# Test production URL
curl https://learntotarkov.com/api/health
# Expected: 200 OK

# Test in browser
# Go to: https://learntotarkov.com
# - Login/signup works
# - Quest tracking functions
# - No console errors
```

### 5. Verify New Documentation

- ✅ [QUICKSTART.md](https://github.com/andrew-tucker-razorvision/EFT-Tracker/blob/master/QUICKSTART.md)
- ✅ [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/andrew-tucker-razorvision/EFT-Tracker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- ✅ [docs/README.md](https://github.com/andrew-tucker-razorvision/EFT-Tracker/blob/master/docs/README.md)
- ✅ [docs/architecture/monorepo.md](https://github.com/andrew-tucker-razorvision/EFT-Tracker/blob/master/docs/architecture/monorepo.md)
- ✅ [docs/architecture/migration-guide.md](https://github.com/andrew-tucker-razorvision/EFT-Tracker/blob/master/docs/architecture/migration-guide.md)

## Monitoring Commands

### GitHub PR Status

```bash
# Get status
gh pr view 312 --json state

# Wait for completion
while gh pr view 312 --json statusCheckRollup | grep -q '"status":"IN_PROGRESS"'; do
  echo "CI still running..."
  sleep 10
done
echo "CI complete!"
```

### Coolify Deployment

```bash
# Get latest deployment
COOLIFY_API_TOKEN=$(echo $CLAUDE_ENV_COOLIFY_API_TOKEN)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $COOLIFY_API_TOKEN" \
  http://95.217.155.28:8000/api/v1/deployments \
  | jq '.[0]'
```

### Production Health

```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl https://learntotarkov.com/api/health -v

# Check Sentry for errors
# Go to: https://sentry.io/ and check EFT-Tracker project

# Monitor logs
# SSH to server: ssh root@95.217.155.28
# Docker logs: docker logs <container-id>
```

## Troubleshooting

### CI Fails

If any CI check fails:

1. **Read the error message** - Usually very specific
2. **Common issues:**
   - Lint error: Run `pnpm lint --fix` locally
   - Type error: Run `pnpm type-check` locally
   - Test failure: Run `pnpm test` locally
3. **Fix locally** and push to same branch
4. **CI re-runs** automatically
5. Merge once all pass

### Deployment Fails

If Coolify deployment fails:

1. **Check logs:**

   ```bash
   ssh root@95.217.155.28
   docker logs <container-id> | tail -50
   ```

2. **Common issues:**
   - Build error: Check nixpacks.toml
   - Startup error: Check environment variables
   - Health check failed: Check application startup

3. **Rollback if needed:**

   ```bash
   git reset --hard pre-monorepo-20251217
   git push -f origin master
   ```

4. **Contact maintainer** if unable to resolve

### Production Issues

If production is broken:

1. **Immediate: Rollback**

   ```bash
   git reset --hard pre-monorepo-20251217
   git push -f origin master
   # Coolify re-deploys automatically
   ```

2. **Investigate:**
   - Check error logs
   - Review recent changes
   - Test locally with same environment

3. **Fix and re-deploy**
   - Create hotfix branch
   - Test thoroughly
   - Merge and deploy

## Success Criteria

Phase 6 is **complete** when:

✅ Phase 5 PR (#312) merged to master
✅ Coolify deployment successful
✅ Production URL loads without errors
✅ Users can login/signup
✅ Quest tracking functions
✅ No Sentry errors
✅ Documentation accessible and clear

## Cleanup

After successful deployment:

1. **Delete feature branch** (after merge)

   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/fix-tauri-release-scripts
   git push origin --delete feature/fix-tauri-release-scripts
   ```

2. **Keep rollback tag** for 30 days

   ```bash
   # Tag already created: pre-monorepo-20251217
   git tag -l | grep pre-monorepo
   ```

3. **Update project status**
   - Mark #270 as complete
   - Add summary to project
   - Celebrate! 🎉

## Timeline

| Step                  | Status | Time           | Notes                        |
| --------------------- | ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| PR #312 created       | ✅     | 17:09:38       | CI started automatically     |
| CI running            | ⏳     | ~5-10 min      | Documentation changes only   |
| CI passes             | ⏳     | Expected       | All checks should pass       |
| Merge to master       | ⏳     | After CI       | One-click merge              |
| Coolify deployment    | ⏳     | ~3-4 min       | Automatic after merge        |
| Production validation | ⏳     | ~5 min         | Manual testing               |
| **Total Phase 6**     | **⏳** | **~15-20 min** | Mostly waiting on automation |

## Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong during Phase 6:

```bash
# Immediate rollback to Phase 4 (before docs)
git reset --hard pre-monorepo-20251217
git push -f origin master

# Coolify detects push and re-deploys
# Production reverts to Phase 4 state (still good!)
```

## Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Announce completion:**
   - Close #270 issue
   - Post summary in project board
   - Announce to team

2. **Monitor for issues:**
   - Watch Sentry for errors (24 hours)
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Keep an eye on user feedback

3. **Plan next phase:**
   - Review lessons learned
   - Plan future improvements
   - Consider development phase for new features

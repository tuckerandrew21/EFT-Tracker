# End Day

Check for open items that need to be closed out before leaving for the day.

## Instructions

Run all checks in parallel, then report a summary.

### 1. Check for uncommitted changes

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

### 2. Check for unpushed commits

```bash
git log origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null
```

### 3. Check current branch

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If not on master, warn that work may be in progress.

### 4. Check for open PRs by me

```bash
gh pr list --state open --author @me
```

For each open PR, check CI status and report if any are ready to merge.

### 5. Check for stashed changes

```bash
git stash list
```

### 6. Check for running dev servers

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

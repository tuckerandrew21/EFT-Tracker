# Change Request Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** For non-trivial changes (bug fixes, features, refactors), follow this workflow:

1. **Research deeply** - Explore the codebase to understand the issue/feature fully
   - Read relevant files and understand existing patterns
   - Identify all affected components
   - Consider edge cases and potential side effects

2. **Create a write-up** - Document findings before implementing:
   - Root cause analysis (for bugs) or design approach (for features)
   - Proposed solution with specific files/functions to modify
   - Any trade-offs or alternative approaches considered

3. **Create GitHub issue** - File an issue with the write-up for tracking

4. **Request review** - Present the write-up to the user for approval
   - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
   - Address any concerns or questions

5. **Implement with approval** - Only after user approves, make the changes
   - Follow the approved approach
   - Test thoroughly before presenting results

This ensures alignment on approach before investing time in implementation.
